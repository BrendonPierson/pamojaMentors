          On Tuesdays through Saturdays, volunteers with Pamoja Mentors take soccer balls and gears to different areas of Uasin Gishu County.  Upon arrival to the community field, youth are invited to participate in friendly soccer matches with the Pamoja Mentors volunteers.  After the games, brief soccer skills clinics and life skills sessions are conducted with the youth participants.

          Every Saturday morning at 8:00am, Pamoja Mentors volunteers take to the streets to interact directly with the many children who live off the streets, having left their homes for any of a variety of reasons.  Through this program, street children are able to escape to a safe field known as Kwa Njega where they can play sports, are provided markers and paper to draw, or simply spend time talking with Pamoja Mentors volunteers.

      <h3 class="title-text">Pamoja Mentors Camp</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The 2016 Pamoja Mentors Camp will be a one week program in Eldoret, Kenya, hosted at the Sirika Pentecostal Fellowship Mission Centre for 120 participants.  The camp will continue to build on the success of previous years’ experience, utilizing athletics, the arts, and other activities as a means of teaching life skills such as teamwork, leadership, communications, and overcoming obstacles to success. The youth participants are invited to the camp at no-cost and is open to any of the kids who participate in the Pamoja Mentors Community, Street, and School Programs throughout the course of the year.

        We are excited to announce that the 2016 camp will be entirely sponsored and lead by our team of Kenyan volunteers, under the direction of our Kenyan Program Manager, Mr. Teddy Lameck.  In order to ensure continuity of mentorship for the youth with whom the Pamoja Mentors engage, summer camp mentors will be members of their community who will continue to support, encourage, and motivate the youth even after the camp ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2016 camp will give 120 participants the opportunity to form teams of 20 youth, with each team being led by 4 Kenyan Mentors who have been active in our School, Community, and Street programs. These mentors will serve as “Team Coaches,” and will lead the youth in a variety of activities throughout the week, coming together as a team and learning from each other. Athletics is a core component of the curriculum, serving as a universally understood means of unifying a group of individuals from different backgrounds. For instance, the camp curriculum leverages the participants’ understanding and enthusiasm for soccer to create drills focused on dealing with adversity or overcoming obstacles. Additional lessons in singing, dancing, or acting help to teach confidence and communication skills. Throughout and at the conclusion of the camp, teams will compete in friendly contests as a way to demonstrate the skills they have learned, and reinforce that together, as a team, each of the participants is able to accomplish more than as an individual.  The camp will conclude with a “Crazy Olympics” to allow participants to showcase what they have learned through friendly competitions against the other teams.  The 2016 Pamoja Mentors Camp will be held from 07-13Aug in Eldoret.
