        <zf-accordion-item title="Street Programs">
          Every Saturday morning at 8:00am, Pamoja Mentors volunteers take to the streets to interact directly with the many children who live off the streets, having left their homes for any of a variety of reasons.  Through this program, street children are able to escape to a safe field known as Kwa Njega where they can play sports, are provided markers and paper to draw, or simply spend time talking with Pamoja Mentors volunteers.

      <h3 class="title-text">Pamoja Mentors Camp</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The Pamoja Mentors Camp is a three week program in Eldoret, Kenya, that utilizes athletics, the arts, and other activities as a means of teaching life skills such as teamwork, leadership, communications, and overcoming obstacles to success.  The youth participants are invited to the camp at no-cost and is open to all kids living in the Rift Valley region of Kenya, including Eldoret and Iten.
      </p>
      <p>
        The camp is designed such that U.S. Student-Athletes partner with Kenyan community leaders to co-coach a “Team” of 15-20 Kenyan youth participants.  Team coaches serve as mentors to these children and lead the youth in a variety of activities throughout the week, coming together as a team and learning from each other.  Athletics is a core component of the curriculum, serving as a universally understood means of unifying a group of individuals from different backgrounds.  For instance, the camp curriculum leverages the participants’ understanding and enthusiasm for soccer to create drills focused on dealing with adversity or overcoming obstacles.  Additional lessons in singing, dancing, or acting help to teach confidence and communication skills.  Throughout and at the conclusion of the camp, teams will compete in friendly contests as a way to demonstrate the skills they have learned, and reinforce that together, as a team, each of the participants is able to accomplish more than as an individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the 2016 Pamoja Mentors camp, approximately 10 U.S. Student-Athletes from Duke University and Boston College will travel to Eldoret, Kenya from late July to mid August.  While in Eldoret, the student-athletes will have the opportunity to meet and interact with some of Kenya’s greatest long distance runners and Olympic Champions who call the region home.  Additionally, the student-athletes will be able to continue their own training in one of the best training environments for Track and Field and Cross Country, enjoying the training benefits of dirt roads and 8000 feet of elevation.  U.S student athletes will stay in Eldoret for the duration of the program, but will have time on the weekends to visit other cities or go on a safari to see some of the African wildlife.  In the end, U.S. participants can expect to gain a greater awareness and appreciation for their ability to serve as a positive influence, understand different cultures and traditions, and enjoy the opportunity to experience life in “The City of Champions,” Eldoret, Kenya.
